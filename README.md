A brief analysis of DAF's manufactures in EU since 1970

DAF, a truck manufacturer located in Eindhoven, has been one the leading companies in this industry. For the purpose of EDA, it was tried to find a set of valid data to analyze the number, design, and technical aspects of DAF’s manufactures in EU. RDW, as the data provider, published a dataset including quite a few records of DAF’s manufactures since 1970 until 2023 in EU. The EDA was done on the dataset and presented in the repository called: DAF_EDA.

For the future analyses, I will try to find a valid dataset of DAF's ELECTRIC trucks manufacturd in EU.
